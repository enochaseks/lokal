# Stripe Connect Made Optional

## Summary of Changes

The shop creation process has been updated to make Stripe Connect payment setup **optional** instead of required. Users can now create shops without setting up automatic payment processing.

## What Changed

### 1. **Payment Setup is Now Optional**
- Users can skip Stripe Connect setup during shop creation
- The system will ask for confirmation if users want to proceed without automatic payments
- Clear messaging explains the implications of not setting up payments

### 2. **Updated User Experience**
- **With Stripe Connect**: Full automatic payment processing (card payments, instant bank deposits)
- **Without Stripe Connect**: Manual payment handling (cash, bank transfers, direct communication with customers)

### 3. **Enhanced Messaging**
- Clear explanations of what happens with and without automatic payments
- Benefits of setting up Stripe Connect are highlighted but not forced
- Users can always add payment processing later through their store settings

## Benefits for Users

### For Users Who Want Manual Payments
- ✅ Can create shops immediately without payment setup barriers
- ✅ Handle payments through preferred methods (cash, bank transfer, etc.)
- ✅ Full control over payment processes
- ✅ Can add automatic payments later when ready
