## 🚀 **How The New System Works**

### **💳 Customer Makes Payment:**
```
1. Customer adds items to cart
2. Proceeds to checkout
3. Pays with card/Google Pay
4. System checks: Does seller have stripeConnectAccountId?
   ❌ NO → Payment fails with error message
   ✅ YES → Money goes directly to seller's Stripe account
5. Platform automatically gets 2.5% fee
6. Seller gets 97.5% instantly in their account
```

### **🏪 Seller Wants to Withdraw:**
```
OLD WAY:
1. Seller fills withdrawal form
2. Platform manually processes
3. Takes days
4. Manual work for platform

NEW WAY:
1. Seller clicks "Withdraw" in Stripe Connect component
2. Instant API call to Stripe
3. Money in bank account 1-2 business days
4. Zero work for platform
```

### **📊 Platform Revenue:**
```
OLD WAY:
- Manual fee calculations
- Manual withdrawal processing
- Hold customer funds
- Complex accounting

NEW WAY:
- Automatic 2.5% deduction
- Zero manual processing
- No funds holding
- Stripe handles everything
```
