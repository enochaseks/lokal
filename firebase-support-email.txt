Subject: Custom Domain Authentication DNS Validation Issue - CNAME Records Not Being Recognized

Dear Firebase Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request assistance with a custom domain authentication setup issue for my Firebase project.

**Project Details:**
- Project ID: lokal-b4b28
- Custom Domain: lokalshops.co.uk
- Issue: Custom domain authentication DNS validation failing despite proper CNAME records

**Problem Description:**
I am attempting to set up custom domain authentication for my Firebase project to use custom email templates with my domain (lokalshops.co.uk). According to your documentation, I need to add specific CNAME records for DNS validation. However, Firebase continues to report that the domain validation is failing.

**Technical Details:**
- Domain: lokalshops.co.uk
- Required CNAME records (as provided by Firebase):
  - firebase1._domainkey.lokalshops.co.uk → mail-lokalshops-co-uk.dkim1._domainkey.firebasemail.com
  - firebase2._domainkey.lokalshops.co.uk → mail-lokalshops-co-uk.dkim2._domainkey.firebasemail.com

**Domain Provider Communication:**
I have contacted my domain provider regarding this issue, and they have confirmed:
1. The CNAME records have been properly added to my DNS configuration on their end
2. Their DNS management system shows the records as active and properly configured
3. They have verified that there are no issues with their DNS propagation
4. They believe this is a Firebase-side validation issue rather than a DNS configuration problem

**DNS Testing Results:**
I have performed DNS lookups using multiple DNS servers (including Google's 8.8.8.8) and continue to receive "Non-existent domain" responses for both required CNAME records:
- firebase1._domainkey.lokalshops.co.uk
- firebase2._domainkey.lokalshops.co.uk

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
1. Confirmed CNAME records are correctly configured with domain provider
2. Waited over 48 hours for DNS propagation
3. Tested DNS resolution using multiple DNS servers
4. Verified domain ownership and Firebase project configuration
5. Double-checked CNAME record syntax and targets

**Request for Assistance:**
Given that my domain provider has confirmed the CNAME records are properly configured on their end, I suspect there may be an issue with:
1. Firebase's DNS validation process
2. The specific CNAME record targets provided by Firebase
3. A potential delay or issue in Firebase's domain verification system

Could you please:
1. Verify the correct CNAME record targets for my domain (lokalshops.co.uk)
2. Check if there are any known issues with the domain validation system
3. Manually trigger a re-validation of my domain's DNS records
4. Investigate if there are any specific requirements or restrictions for .co.uk domains

**Additional Information:**
- I am willing to provide screenshots of my domain provider's DNS configuration if needed
- The domain is active and properly resolving for other records
- This is for a production application with active users waiting for email authentication features

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue. Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any other troubleshooting steps I should take.

Thank you for your time and support.
