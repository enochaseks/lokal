## 🎯 Features

### Automatic Notifications
The system automatically sends notifications for:

- ✉️ **New Messages** - When someone sends you a message
- 📦 **New Orders** - When a buyer places an order
- 💰 **Payments** - When you receive a payment
- ⭐ **Reviews** - When someone reviews your store
- 🚀 **Store Boosts** - When your store boost is activated

### User Controls
- Beautiful permission prompt on first visit
- Settings page to enable/disable notifications
- Respects user's notification preferences
- Platform and browser detection

### Smart Behavior
- Works in foreground (app open) and background (app closed)
- Clicking notification opens the relevant page
- Removes invalid tokens automatically
- Queues notifications if user is offline

## 🔧 What You Need To Do

### Required: Add VAPID Key

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: **lokal-b4b28**
3. Go to **Project Settings** → **Cloud Messaging**
4. Under **Web Push certificates**, click **Generate key pair**
5. Copy the key

6. Update **`src/services/pushNotificationService.js`** (line ~65):
```javascript
vapidKey: 'BNxxx...' // Replace with your actual key
```

### Deploy Functions

```powershell
cd functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

This deploys 6 new functions:
- `sendMessageNotification`
- `sendOrderNotification`
- `sendPaymentNotification`
- `sendReviewNotification`
- `sendStoreBoostNotification`
- `sendCustomPushNotification`

### Update Firestore Rules

Add the rules from `firestore-push-notification-rules.txt` to your `firestore.rules` file.

## 🧪 Testing

1. Start your app: `npm start`
2. Log in with a test account
3. Allow notifications when prompted
4. Test by:
   - Sending yourself a message from another account
   - Placing a test order
   - Navigate away from the app (different tab)
   - Trigger an action that should send a notification

## 📱 Browser Support

| Browser | Support | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Chrome | ✅ Full | Desktop & Android |
| Firefox | ✅ Full | Desktop & Android |
| Safari | ✅ Limited | macOS 13+, iOS 16.4+ (requires Add to Home Screen) |
| Edge | ✅ Full | Desktop |
| Opera | ✅ Full | Desktop & Android |

## 🎨 User Experience

### First Time User Flow:
1. User logs in
2. After 3 seconds, beautiful prompt appears
3. User sees benefits of enabling notifications
4. Can enable, dismiss, or remind later
5. If enabled, notifications work immediately

### Notification Click Behavior:
- **Message notification** → Opens Messages page with conversation
- **Order notification** → Opens Receipts page with order
- **Payment notification** → Opens Receipts page with payment
- **Review notification** → Opens Store page with review
- **Store boost** → Opens Store Profile page

## 🔒 Security

- FCM tokens stored securely in Firestore
- Only users can access their own tokens
- Invalid tokens automatically removed
- Server key kept private in Cloud Functions
- VAPID key is public (safe to include in code)

## 📊 Monitoring

Monitor notifications in Firebase Console:
- **Cloud Messaging** → View send/delivery statistics
- **Functions** → Check function logs
- **Firestore** → View `fcmTokens` collection

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Notifications not working?
1. Check VAPID key is configured
2. Verify service worker is registered: Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
3. Check FCM token in Firestore `fcmTokens` collection
4. Verify functions are deployed
5. Check browser console for errors

### Permission blocked?
Guide users to:
- **Chrome**: Click lock icon → Site Settings → Notifications → Allow
- **Firefox**: Click shield icon → Permissions → Notifications → Allow
- **Safari**: Safari → Preferences → Websites → Notifications → Allow

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Add VAPID key (5 minutes)
2. ✅ Deploy functions (2 minutes)
3. ✅ Test thoroughly (10 minutes)
4. ✅ Update Firestore rules (2 minutes)
5. ✅ Deploy to production

## 📝 Notes

- Service worker must be at root: `/firebase-messaging-sw.js`
- iOS Safari requires "Add to Home Screen" for notifications
- Notifications work offline and queue for delivery
- Users can manage preferences in Settings page
- System respects user notification preferences from Firestore

## 🎉 Benefits

🔔 **Real-time Updates** - Instant notifications for important events
📱 **Cross-Platform** - Works on desktop and mobile browsers
⚡ **Automatic** - No manual triggering needed, fully automated
🎯 **Smart Routing** - Clicks open the right page automatically
🛡️ **Secure** - Built on Firebase's secure infrastructure
