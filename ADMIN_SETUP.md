1. Go to `/admin-setup` in your browser (or click "üõ†Ô∏è Admin Setup" in the menu)
2. Enter the email and password of an existing user account you want to make admin
3. If the account doesn't exist, first register it normally, then return to admin setup
4. Login with those credentials - the system will check if already an admin
5. If not an admin, enter the admin name and click "Create Admin Access"
6. You'll be automatically redirected to the admin dashboard

## Admin Routes
- `/admin-setup` - Admin creation page (accessible to everyone)

## User Types and Access

## Security Notes
- Admin setup page is accessible to everyone (intended for initial setup)
- Admins are verified through Firestore `admins` collection
- Only authenticated admin users can access admin routes
- Admin setup page should be secured or removed in production

## Removing Admin Setup in Production
For production deployment, remove or restrict access to `/admin-setup` route in `src/App.js` and remove the admin setup links from the navigation to prevent unauthorized admin creation.

## Support
For issues with the admin system, check the browser console for error messages and ensure the user exists in the `admins` collection with proper permissions.
