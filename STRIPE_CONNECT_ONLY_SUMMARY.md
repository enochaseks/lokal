# ✅ **STRIPE CONNECT ONLY - NO VIRTUAL WALLET**

## 🎯 **What I Fixed**

### **1. Payment Processing (MessagesPage.js)**
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Virtual wallet fallback logic
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Dual payment system
- ✅ **NOW:** ALL payments MUST go through Stripe Connect
- ✅ **ERROR:** If seller has no Connect account, payment fails with clear message

### **2. Shop Creation (CreateShopPage.js)**

- ✅ **NOW:** Stripe Connect is MANDATORY before shop creation
- ✅ **BLOCKS:** Cannot create shop without Connect account
- ✅ **MESSAGE:** Clear warning that virtual wallets are no longer supported

### **3. Wallet Interface (MessagesPage.js)**
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Virtual wallet balance cards
