# Buyer Receipt Integration Guide

This document explains the new feature that ensures receipts generated by sellers are automatically stored in the buyer's receipt page.

## Overview

When a seller generates an order receipt, the system now automatically creates a duplicate of that receipt in the buyer's account. This ensures that:

1. Buyers have a complete record of all receipts for their purchases
2. Sellers don't need to manually ensure buyers receive receipts
3. All transaction records are properly maintained for both parties

## How It Works

The implementation uses a Firebase Cloud Function that:

1. Listens for new receipt documents created in the 'receipts' collection
2. Checks if the receipt has a valid buyerId that differs from the userId (seller)
3. Creates a duplicate receipt document with the buyerId set as the userId
4. Adds special flags to prevent duplicate processing and maintain relationships

## Technical Implementation

The feature is implemented using:

1. A Firebase Cloud Function (`storeBuyerReceipt`)
2. A trigger on the 'receipts' collection

The function preserves all original receipt data while:
- Setting the userId field to match the buyer's ID so it appears in their receipts page
- Adding an `isBuyerCopy: true` flag to prevent infinite loops
- Maintaining a reference to the original receipt ID
- Using server timestamps to ensure proper ordering

## Testing the Feature

To test this feature:

1. Log in as a seller account
2. Navigate to ReportsPage and generate a receipt for an order
3. Log in as the buyer account
4. Navigate to the ReceiptsPage
5. Verify that the receipt appears in the buyer's receipts list

## Troubleshooting

If receipts aren't appearing in the buyer's account:

1. Check Firebase Functions logs for any errors in the `storeBuyerReceipt` function
2. Verify that the receipt document contains both a valid `sellerId` and `buyerId`
3. Confirm that the receipt is being properly saved to the 'receipts' collection
4. Ensure that the buyer ID is correctly set in the order data

## Deployment Notes

This feature requires:

1. Deploying the new cloud function (`firebase deploy --only functions:storeBuyerReceipt`)
2. Ensuring Firebase Functions are properly configured and have access to Firestore

No changes to the frontend code are needed as the existing ReceiptsPage already queries for receipts where the userId matches the current user's ID.
