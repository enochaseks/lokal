# 💰 Wallet Integration with Refund System - COMPLETE

## ✅ **Updates Made**

### **🔧 New Functionality Added:**

1. **Seller Wallet Deduction**: When refunds are processed, the seller's wallet balance is automatically reduced by the refund amount

2. **Payment Method Detection**: Enhanced logic to properly identify digital wallet payments (Google Pay, Apple Pay, etc.)

3. **Transaction Audit Trail**: All refunds now create transaction records with:
   - Negative amounts (deductions)
   - Payment method tracking
   - Stripe refund IDs
   - Complete audit information

4. **Wallet Balance Protection**: Prevents negative wallet balances (minimum balance of 0)

### **🎯 How It Works Now:**

#### **For Card & Digital Wallet Payments:**
1. Customer requests refund → System processes Stripe refund
2. **NEW**: Seller wallet balance reduced by refund amount
3. **NEW**: Transaction record created with refund details
4. Customer receives confirmation with refund ID
5. Money appears in customer's original payment method (2-5 days)

#### **For Bank Transfer Payments:**
1. Customer requests refund → Seller notified for manual transfer
2. Seller transfers money directly from their bank → Customer receives directly
3. **NO WALLET DEDUCTION**: Bank transfers never go through seller wallet
4. Manual verification process for transfer confirmation

### **📊 Wallet Database Structure:**
