## 💰 **How The Money Flow Works**

### **🔄 New Sellers (Post-Implementation):**
```
1. Seller creates account → 2. MUST set up Stripe Connect → 3. Shop created with Connect ID
4. Buyer pays → 5. Real money goes to seller's Stripe account → 6. Seller withdraws to bank
```

### **⚡ Existing Sellers (Upgrade Path):**
```
1. Seller logs in → 2. Sees upgrade banner in wallet → 3. Clicks "Set Up Payment Account"
4. Completes Stripe onboarding → 5. Future payments become real money
```
